# bbjson-mode.el
a barebones JSON emacs major-mode
## Why?
I didn't like how existing JSON modes inherited from Javascript major-modes, and I wanted to (try to) learn more about how SMIE works.
## Installation
`(straight-use-package '(bbjson-mode :type git :host github :repo "orzechowskid/bbjson-mode.el"))`
